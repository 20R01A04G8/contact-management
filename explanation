1. *Customer Data Storage*: Instead of using a database, the code utilizes a Python list named customers to store customer information. Each customer's details are stored as a dictionary within this list.

2. *add_customer Function*:
   - This function takes three parameters: name, email, and phone, representing the details of a new customer.
   - It creates a dictionary named customer containing the provided details.
   - The dictionary is then appended to the customers list.
   - Finally, it prints a message confirming the successful addition of the customer.

3. *view_customers Function*:
   - This function iterates over the customers list and prints the details of each customer.
   - It uses enumerate to get both the index and the customer dictionary.
   - For each customer, it prints their name, email, and phone number.

4. *Main Menu Loop*:
   - The program enters a while loop that displays the main menu options until the user chooses to exit.
   - The menu options are presented using print statements.
   - The user's choice is obtained using the input function.
   - Depending on the user's choice, the program calls the appropriate function (add_customer, view_customers) or exits the loop.

5. *Menu Options*:
   - *Add Customer*: Prompts the user to enter details for a new customer and calls the add_customer function to add them to the list.
   - *View Customers*: Calls the view_customers function to display the details of all existing customers.
   - *Exit*: Terminates the program.

Overall, this code provides a basic Customer Management System that allows users to add new customers, view existing customers, and exit the program, all through a simple command-line interface.
